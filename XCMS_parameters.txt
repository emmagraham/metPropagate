XCMS parameters were optimized by the IPO package, and are listed here. Peak picking was performed using the centwave algorithm within the findChromPeaks function, which had the following parameters: ppm = 15, peakdwidth = 3 – 80, mzdiff = 0.00325, prefilter = 3 – 100, noise = 1000, snthresh = 10. Peaks were grouped using the groupChromPeaks function with the sample grouping (IEM/control) as input. Retention time correction was performed using the obiwarp algorithm within the adjustRtime function using all default parameters except: gapInit = 1.2736 and gapExtend = 3.3336. Peaks were grouped again with the groupChromPeaks with the same parameters as used previously. Peaks were filled using the fillChromPeaks with all default parameters. An intensity matrix was extracted using the featureValues function (method = “medret”, value = “into”).
